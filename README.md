# Recipe Website 
This website contains links to different recipes. It was a mini-project I created to put into practice what I learned about the basics of HTML.
# Lessons Learned:
This website incorporates a range of HTML elements, such as anchors, paragraphs, headings, and images. Building it allowed me to deepen my understanding of these elements and their practical uses.
