    <p>Garlic Knot Chicken is a flavorful, pan-seared chicken dish coated in a buttery garlic sauce, topped with Parmesan and fresh parsley, 
        and served with optional lemon wedges for a bright, zesty finish.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>

        <li>1 teaspoon kosher salt, plus more to taste</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</li>
        <li>4 large cloves garlic, minced</li>
